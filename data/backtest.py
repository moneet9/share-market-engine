    Feeds historical events into the matching engine in timestamp order.
    After each historical event is submitted, each agent gets a chance to
    react via on_market_data(). Fills are routed to the relevant agents.

    Parameters
    ----------
    replay_source : Generator
        A generator that yields events. Each event must have at minimum:
        - timestamp_ns (int): event timestamp in nanoseconds
        - to_order() method or be an Order object directly
        For LobsterReplay.events() or DatabentoReplay.events(), use the
        events generator. For simple replay, use .generate() which yields
        Order objects directly.
    agents : list
        List of BaseAgent instances to participate in the backtest.
    max_events : int, optional
        Maximum number of events to process. None means process all.
    snapshot_interval : int
        Take a PnL/inventory snapshot every N events. Default 100.

    Returns
    -------
    BacktestResult
        Comprehensive results including time series and summary statistics.
